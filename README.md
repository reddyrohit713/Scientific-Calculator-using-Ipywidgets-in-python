# Scientific-Calculator-using-Ipywidgets-in-python
This project is an interactive Scientific Calculator built using IPyWidgets in Python. The calculator provides a simple, intuitive, and interactive interface for performing a wide range of mathematical calculations, from basic arithmetic to advanced scientific functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentiation.
Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Scientific Functions: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, exponents, and square roots.
Interactive Interface: Built using IPyWidgets for an easy-to-use, GUI-like experience in Jupyter notebooks.
Real-time Output: Immediate evaluation of expressions and display of results.
Customizable Layout: You can easily modify the layout and add additional functions to suit specific needs.
